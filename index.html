      <p style="text-align: center;"> This site is designed to help primates control their savings.A bank is a financial
        institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates credit.Lending activities can be performed either directly
        or indirectly through capital markets. Due to their importance in the financial stability of a country, banks are
        highly regulated in most countries. Most nations have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking
        under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities. In addition to other regulations
        intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international
        set of capital standards, known as the Basel Accords.</p>
